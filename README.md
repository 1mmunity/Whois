> NOTE: Whois is built on top of Next.js
Whois is an already built site for telling who you are and what you do.  
No backend needed or additional programming.

To configure your own tabs, projects, etc., head to **line 98** in `pages/index.js` and edit the arrays to your own likings.  
**You do not need to credit me if you want to use this.**
